This project focuses on analyzing call-center data to extract insights regarding performance, efficiency, and customer satisfaction. By leveraging various data analysis techniques, we aim to provide recommendations for improving call-center operations.

## Project Objectives
- Analyze call-center performance metrics.
- Identify trends and patterns in customer interactions.
- Determine factors affecting customer satisfaction and call resolution.
- Suggest strategies for improving overall call-center efficiency.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains information on:
- Call durations
- Call resolution status
- Agent performance
- Customer feedback

## Tools and Libraries
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

## Key Analysis Performed
1. **Descriptive Analysis**: Summary statistics of call-center performance metrics.
2. **Correlation Analysis**: Correlations between agent performance and call resolution rates.
3. **Customer Satisfaction**: Analyzing customer feedback to identify satisfaction trends.
4. **Predictive Modeling**: Developing a model to predict call resolution based on initial call metrics.

## Results
- Average call duration was approximately X minutes.
- Agents with higher average resolution rates tended to handle fewer calls per hour.
- Customer satisfaction was closely linked with the call resolution time and agent behavior.


## Project Overview

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, we found several factors impacting both call-center performance and customer satisfaction. Recommendations have been made to improve key areas like agent training, call handling efficiency, and enhancing the feedback collection process.

## Future Work
- Implement real-time dashboards for call-center monitoring.
- Explore advanced machine learning techniques for predictive analysis.
- Perform sentiment analysis on customer feedback for deeper insights.
